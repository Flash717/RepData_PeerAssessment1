## Introduction
This document is for the Peer Assessment 1 of the Coursera Reproducible Research course by Roger Peng.


## Loading and preprocessing the data
First we set the working directory:
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/Florian/Documents/Development/git/RepData_PeerAssessment1");
activity <- read.table(file="activity.csv", 
                       header=TRUE,
                       sep=",",
                       colClasses=c("numeric","character","numeric"));
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d");
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
We use function mean on column 'steps' of data-frame 'activity' and remove any possible 'NA' values.
```{r}
mean(activity$steps, na.rm=TRUE);
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
